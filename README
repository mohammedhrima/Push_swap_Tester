1. copy ./push_swap (executable in Push_swap_tester folder)
1. run python3 number_generator (to generate numbers)
2. copy them
3. run: make re
4. run: ./tester "copied_numbers"
5. to speed up timing of writing:
    run: "make re T=1" / choose a a value less than 40
    or change TIMING macro manually (line 7 in tester.c)
    I did set T to 40
