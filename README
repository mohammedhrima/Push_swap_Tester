1. copy ./push_swap (executable in Push_swap_tester folder)

2. generate numbers by running: make nums

3. copy them numbers

4. run: make

5. run: ./tester "copied_numbers"

6. to speed up timing of writing (in step 4):
    run: "make re T=1" / choose a value less than 40
    or change TIMING macro manually (line 7 in tester.c)
    I did set it to 40
